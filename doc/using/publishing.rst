A browser, similar to the file browser, will appear, but it allows browsing
ftrack rather than the filesystem.

You can navigate through a project structure by double clicking on items in the
list. A navigation bar at the top will show you where you are and you can also
click an item in the navigation bar to jump back up the hierarchy.
Alternatively, use the neighbouring :guilabel:`Navigate Up` tool button to move
up a level at a time.

.. note::

    If an item you expect to see in the list is not appearing, try clicking the
    :guilabel:`Reload` tool button to refresh the list from the server.

To select the entity to link against, select an item in the list and then click
the :guilabel:`Choose` button. Alternatively, to cancel making any changes
click the :guilabel:`Cancel` button.
